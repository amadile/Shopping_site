## Next Steps

I would welcome the opportunity to:

4. **Discuss a phased onboarding approach** if immediate full approval isn't possible

## Alternative Proposal

If immediate full approval is challenging, I propose:

**Pilot Program Approach:**
- Start with limited transaction volume cap ($50,000/month)
- Demonstrate platform growth and transaction quality
- Increase limits as we prove our projections
- Graduate to full enterprise partnership within 6 months

This allows Flutterwave to validate our platform while minimizing risk.

## Conclusion

Amadile represents a unique opportunity for Flutterwave to partner with a high-growth platform from inception. Our multi-vendor model means we're not just one business - we're an aggregator of hundreds of businesses, each contributing to substantial collective transaction volume.

We're not asking for special treatment as a small business; we're presenting ourselves as an **enterprise-level opportunity** with a clear path to significant processing volume.

I am confident that within 12 months, Amadile will be processing transaction volumes that exceed your enterprise thresholds, and I would prefer to build that success with Flutterwave as our payment partner from day one.

Thank you for reconsidering our application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss this further.
